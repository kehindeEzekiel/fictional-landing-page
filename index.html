                <p>Imagine the essence of time being able to be controlled on your wrist. A small, undistinguishable watch that can stop and start time whenever you want it to. Feel like being lazy and don’t want to go to class? Why not just stop the time and take a nap to reenergize! 
                    Then when you’re ready, just make your way over to class.</p>

                <p> Transportation plays a huge role in a person’s day-to-day life. We spend a large amount of our lifetime commuting for obligations. We have to set aside time in our day to account for travel time to get to and from wherever we go, and it adds up over time. So why not invest in something that could get you wherever you want to go in a blink of an eye? It would save you immense amounts
                     of time commuting, but also take you wherever your heart desires to travel.</p>
